# Project Tiny Samples
This repository contains samples for Project Tiny.
Please [read through the Project Tiny guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8hen2hLFY5FLkC5gd3JP2Z-IpHfnAX-CpYLK3aOdwA/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the current project state, limitations, and getting started information.

Current samples:

- Tiny3D sample is a "Hello World" style sample with minimal assets & code. It's a great starting point for a new "clean" project.

- TinyRacing sample is intended as a lightweight example of the type of content you can build with Project Tiny. It is a complete game slice showing a number of elements such as accepting input, implementing simple AI, handling collisions, and similar. Please explore and play around with the sample project to get a feel for what developing with pure DOTS looks like.
