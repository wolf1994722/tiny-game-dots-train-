# TinyRacing DOTS Runtime 3D demo
The TinyRacing sample project is intended as a lightweight example of the type of content you can build with Project Tiny.  It is a complete game slice showing a number of elements such as accepting input, implementing simple AI, handling collisions, and similar.  Please explore and play around with the sample project to get a feel for what developing with pure DOTS looks like.</BR>
Some aspects of this project are workarounds for missing overall features (such as UI), but will be replaced by the real solution once those features become available.
Please [read through the guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8hen2hLFY5FLkC5gd3JP2Z-IpHfnAX-CpYLK3aOdwA/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the current project state, limitations, and getting started information.
